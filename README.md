MoveOD generates calibrated origin-destination commute data for a U.S. state and county using Census, road network, and building-footprint data. The project is designed to run either from the command line or through a Streamlit web app.

## Overview

MoveOD is a transportation data generation pipeline that combines public spatial and commute data to synthesize origin-destination trip tables.

### What it does

1. Processes LODES employment flows from the U.S. Census.
2. Integrates building footprints from Microsoft Global Buildings and OpenStreetMap.
3. Routes trips on road graphs using OSM defaults or INRIX speeds when available.
4. Calibrates generated trips with Integer Linear Programming.
5. Produces county-level OD outputs with sampled locations and departure times.

## Quickstart

### 1. Requirements

- Python 3.12 on Linux.
- A free U.S. Census API key for LODES and geographic downloads.

### 2. Configure the Census API key

1. Get a free key from [Census API Key Signup](https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html).
2. Copy the environment template:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Edit `.env` and replace `YOUR_CENSUS_API_KEY_HERE` with your key.

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you want to use the backend web app, install its extra dependencies too:

```bash
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

Optional: if you have IBM CPLEX installed, set its path before running the pipeline to speed up ILP calibration.

```bash
export CPLEX_PATH=</path/to/cplex>
```

### 4. Start the app

Command line:

```bash
python cli.py -i
```

Streamlit:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Using the web app

1. Select the state and county you want to process.
2. Choose the available data sources for the region.
3. Add optional inputs such as INRIX speeds if you have them.
4. Pick a date or date range when using time-dependent traffic data.
5. Click the start button to run the pipeline.
6. Watch progress in the UI and download the output when it finishes.

Typical runtime is about 20 minutes for smaller regions and up to around 2 hours for larger ones.

## Output

Outputs are written under `move_OD/{state}/{county}/{start_date}_{end_date}/`.

Key results include:

- `calibrated_move_od/{day}.csv` for the final OD trips.
- `intermediate/{day}/routing_df.parquet` for routed trips.
- `intermediate/{day}/post_mssr_routing_df.parquet` after speed rescaling.
- `intermediate/{day}/hourly_graphs_adjusted.json` for adjusted graphs.

Typical columns include origin and destination GEOIDs, sampled home and work coordinates, departure time, and estimated travel time.

## Reproducibility

The paper figures can be regenerated from the output directory after a run:

```bash
python analysis/figures_from_output.py --state Tennessee --county Hamilton
```

The notebook in `analysis/figures_1_2.ipynb` shows the same workflow for Figures 1 and 2. Figure 3 in the paper is a downstream demonstration of how the generated data can be used.

Because road speeds may be sampled and INRIX is optional, reruns are expected to be qualitatively similar rather than byte-for-byte identical.

## Troubleshooting

If you see Streamlit warnings about missing script context during parallel processing, they are expected and harmless.

If you want to force sequential execution, set:

```bash
export FORCE_SEQUENTIAL_OSM=true
```

If OSM queries time out, try a smaller county, wait a few minutes, or rerun during off-peak hours. The pipeline already retries failed requests and falls back to sequential processing when needed.
